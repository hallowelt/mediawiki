* Class aliases to support the old PHPUnit 4 style un-namespaced `PHPUnit_`

  will create a temporary account and log the user in for unsuccessful edit
  attempts and null edits, in addition to edits that change content. This is
  a change from the previous paradigm, where temporary accounts were created
  only for successful edits. This change is done to support better logging
  support and moderation, to ensure that hooks run in a pre-save context have
  a user object to associate log entries and other actions with.
* Several entries have been removed from the default list of interwikis used
  when installing new wikis. This does not affect existing wikis.
