=== Breaking changes in 1.36 ===
* The global function `wfWaitForSlaves`, deprecated since 1.27 & hard-deprecated

* The User class, which was marked as @newable in 1.35, is no longer newable,
  meaning that it is no longer safe to manually call the constructor via
  `new User`. Instead, use the UserFactory service.
