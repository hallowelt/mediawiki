== MediaWiki 1.35.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.35 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
1.35 has several database changes since 1.34, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.35 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.34.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.35 ===

…

==== New configuration ====
* $wgDiffEngine can be used to specify the difference engine to use, rather
  than choosing the first of $wgExternalDiffEngine, wikidiff2, or php that
  is usable.
* $wgSearchMatchRedirectPreference – This configuration setting controls whether
  users can set a new preference, search-match-redirect, which decides if search
  should redirect them to exact matches is available. By default, this is set to
  false, which maintains the previous behaviour without preference bloat. Change
  your site's default by setting $wgDefaultUserOptions['search-match-redirect'].
* Per-user concurrency in SpecialContributions can now be limited by setting
  $wgPoolCounterConf['SpecialContributions'] appropriately.
* Added new PasswordPolicyCheck: PasswordCannotBeSubstringInUsername.  Similar
  to the existing PasswordCannotMatchUsername check, this check ensures that
  a user's (case-insensitive) password cannot be a part of their username.
  e.g. password = MyPassword, username = ThisUsersPasswordIsMyPassword.
* $wgLogos – This new configuration setting combines the now-deprecated $wgLogo
  and $wgLogoHD settings into a single, associative array. It provides support
  for a new key, 'wordmark', for setting a horizontal wordmark to show next to
  the graphical logo. To do this, set 'wordmark' to an array with 'src' set to
  the path of the wordmark image, and 'width' and 'height' for its dimensions
  in pixels. $wgLogos inherits the existing support provided by its predecessor
  settings: '1x' mapping to the path of the logo as a 135x135px raster image
  (equivalent to $wgLogo), and '1.5x', '2x', and 'svg' operating as before for
  $wgLogoHD. If $wgLogos is unset, $wgLogo and $wgLogoHD values are read for
  temporary backwards compatibility. (T232140)
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgResourceLoaderMaxage (T235314) - This configuration array controls the
  max-age for HTTP caching through the Cache-Control header. It has uses the
  "versioned" key for urls that do have a version parameter, and the
  "unversioned" key for urls without a version parameter. The sub keys for
  "client" and "server" are no longer supported in MediaWiki 1.35.
* $wgEnableOpenSearchSuggest - This boolean variable is deprecated and no longer
  used. The OpenSearch API is now always enabled.
* $wgAuthManagerConfig and $wgAuthManagerAutoConfig can now use the 'services'
  option in provider specifications.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgSysopEmailBans — This setting, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. To let
  sysops block email access, use $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['blockemail'].
* $wgDBWindowsAuthentication — This setting had no effect anymore after support
  for SQL Server was removed in 1.34. (T230418)
* $wgProfileOnly — This setting, deprecated in 1.23, was removed. The profiler
  output should instead be configured via $wgProfiler['output'].
* $wgProfileLimit - This setting, deprecated in 1.25, was removed.
  Set $wgProfiler['threshold'] instead.
* $wgDebugTimestamps - This setting was removed. It affected the text output
  produced via $wgDebugComments, if enabled.
* $wgSkipSkin - This setting, deprecated in 1.23, was removed. To disable a
  skin from being shown, use $wgSkipSkins.
* $wgUseSquid, $wgSquidServers, $wgSquidServersNoPurge, and $wgSquidMaxage,
  deprecated in 1.34, have been removed. Use $wgUseCdn, $wgCdnServers,
  $wgCdnServersNoPurge, or $wgCdnMaxAge instead.
* $wgDisableCounters, deprecated in 1.25, was removed. The feature that it
  controlled was already removed in 1.26, but the variable remained existent
  with a value of `false` for backward-compatibility.
* $wgMaxGeneratedPPNodeCount - This setting was removed.  It only affected
  Preprocessor_DOM, which was deprecated in 1.34 and removed in this release.
* $wgFixArabicUnicode and $wgFixMalayalamUnicode, deprecated in 1.33, were
  removed. The fixes are now always enabled for their respective languages.
* $wgAllowTitlesInSVG, unused and deprecated since 1.34, was removed.
* $wgEnablePartialBlocks - This setting, deprecated when it was added in 1.33,
  was removed. Partial blocks are now always enabled.
* $wgLocalInterwiki, deprecated in 1.23 has been removed.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.35 ===
* (T204618) Whitelisted the aria-hidden HTML attribute for all elements in
  wikitext.
* (T13456) Special:EditPage, Special:PageHistory, Special:PageInfo, and
  Special:Purge have been created as shortcuts for each action.
  Special:EditPage/Foo redirects to title=foo&action=edit, with PageHistory,
  PageInfo, and Purge corresponding to action= history, info, and purge
  respectively. When linked to, its subpage is used as the target. Otherwise,
  it displays a basic interface to allow the end user to specify the target
  manually.
* (T139221) The generated table of contents is now a navigation landmark role
  for assistive technologies.
* (T245931) interwiki map API doesn't report foreign language if
  $wgInterwikiMagic=false
* …

=== New developer features in 1.35 ===
* A Docker based local development develpoment environment configuration is
  included (T238224) and DEVELOPERS.md has been added with usage documentation
  and links to further help.
* If CSP is enabled, extensions can now add additional sources using the
  ContentSecurityPolicy::addDefaultSource, ::addStyleSrc and ::addScriptSrc
  methods (e.g. $context->getOutput()->getCSP()->addDefaultSrc( 'example.com' ))
* Extensions can now specify classes and namespaces to be autoloaded by the
  test autoloader, by setting the "TestAutoloadNamespaces" and
  "TestAutoloadClasses" properties in extension.json. (T196090)
* Added getters for OutputPage's robot, index and follow policies;
  getRobotPolicy() returns the entire policy as a string in the form
  <index policy>,<follow policy> while getIndexPolicy() and getFollowPolicy()
  return their respective policies as a string.
* The ResourceLoaderSiteModulePages and ResourceLoaderSiteStylesModulePages
  hooks were added to allow changing which wiki pages these modules contain.
* The SkinFactory now allows skins to be specified as an ObjectFactory spec,
  allowing the construction of skins with services injected.
* ContentHandlerFactory for most ContentHandler static methods. It has been
  added to the constructors for many classes to improve SOLID / GRASP.
* FileDeleteForm's constructor now accepts a user as the second parameter.
  Support for not passing a user has also been hard-deprecated and will be
  removed in 1.36.
* The ParserPreSaveTransformComplete hook was added.
* The ResourceLoaderSkinModule class now has a "legacy" feature that loads
  the stylesheets previously part of the "mediawiki.legacy.shared" and
  "mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint" module.
  Those modules are now deprecated and no longer loaded by skins.
  For skins needing to retain these styles, you will need to load these
  styles via a module using the ResourceLoaderSkinModule class.
  See Vector and Monobook for examples.
* ParserOutput now has methods addExtraCSPStyleSrc, addExtraCSPDefaultSrc
  addExtraCSPScriptSrc for parser tags/functions to be able to add sources
  to the Content Security Policy.
* …

* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.35 ===
* …

=== Action API changes in 1.35 ===
* The 'suggest' parameter of action=opensearch has been deprecated.
  The API behaves the same with and without this parameter.
  It was previously used by $wgEnableOpenSearchSuggest to partially
  disable the API if set to false. Specifically, it would deny internal
  frontend requests carrying this parameter, whilst accepting other requests.
* Integer-type parameters are now validated for syntax rather than being
  interpreted in surprising ways. For example, the following will now return a
  badinteger error:
  * "1.9" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * " 1" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * "1e1" (formerly interpreted as "1" or "10", depending on the PHP version)
  * "1foobar" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * "foobar" (formerly intepreted as "0")
  parameters. Ranges should be assumed to be enforced.
* Many user-type parameters now accept a user ID, formatted like "#12345".
* The 'assert' parameter used by all API modules now supports the value 'anon'.
  When specified, the API will return the 'assertanonfailed' error if the user
  is logged in.
* action=edit now supports  the 'baserevid' parameter for edit conflict
  detection, as an alternative to 'basetimestamp'. Note that self-conflicts
  will continue to be ignored if 'basetimestamp' is set, but not if only
  'baserevid' is set.
* A new module was added to change the content model of existing pages.
  Use action=changecontentmodel. Unlike Special:ChangeContentModel, the api
  module does not work for pages that do not already exist.
* …

=== Action API internal changes in 1.35 ===
* The Action API now uses the Wikimedia\ParamValidator library for parameter
  validation, which brings some new features and changes. For the most part
  existing module code should work as it did before, but see subsequent notes
  for changes.
  * The values for all ApiBase PARAM_* constants have changed. Code should have
    been using the constants rather than hard-coding the values.
  * Several ApiBase PARAM_* constants have been deprecated, see the in-class
    documentation for details. Use the equivalent ParamValidator constants
    instead.
  * The value returned for 'upload'-type parameters has changed from
    WebRequestUpload to Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileInterface.
* Validation of 'user'-type parameters is more flexible. PARAM constants exist
  to specify the type of "user" allowed and to request UserIdentity objects
  rather than name strings. The default is to accept all types (name, IP,
  range, and interwiki) that were formerly accepted.
* Maximum limits are no longer ignored in "internal mode".
* The $paramName to ApiBase::handleParamNormalization() should now include the
  prefix.
* (T245931) meta=siteinfo&siprop=interwikimap no longer reports language or
  extralanglink when $wgInterwikiMagic is false.
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.35 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* The default targets for the ISBN search from Special:BookSources in English
  have been updated for better international suppport. They will now be
  BetterWorldBooks.com, OpenLibrary.org and Worldcat.org.
* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.35 ===

  deprecated in 1.34, have been removed. Use "jquery.ui" instead.
* The internal variable $constructorOptions for the Parser & SpecialPageFactory,
  exposed only for integration purposes, are now each replaced by a const called
  CONSTRUCTOR_OPTIONS. This was a breaking change made without deprecation.
* ObjectCache::getWANInstance, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Use MediaWikiServices::getMainWANObjectCache instead.
* ObjectCache::newWANCacheFromParams, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.

  deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
* SiteConfiguration->localVHosts, deprecated in 1.25, was removed.
  Use $wgLocalVirtualHosts instead.
* The $wgContLanguageCode read-only variable was removed.
  It has been a non-configurable copy of $wgLanguageCode since MW 1.8 (2006).
  Use $wgLanguageCode directly instead.
* ApiQueryUserInfo::getBlockInfo, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. Use
  ApiBlockInfoTrait::getBlockDetails instead.
* Password::equals(), deprecated in 1.33, was removed. Use Password::verify().

  - disableCache(), deprecated in 1.28.
  - serializeHalfParsedText() and the helpers unserializeHalfParsedText(),
    isValidHalfParsedText(), and StripState::getSubState() and
    StripState::merge(), all deprecated in 1.31. The helper functions
    LinkHolderArray::mergeForeign() and LinkHolderArray::getSubArray()
    were also removed.
  - getConverterLanguage(), deprecated in 1.32. Use getTargetLanguage() instead.
  - A large set of methods exposed only for historical reasons, deprecated in
    1.34, have now been removed or made private:

  This use pattern was deprecated in 1.34.
* MediaWikiTestCase::prepareServices(), deprecated in 1.32, has been removed
* The method ContentHandler::getSlotDiffRendererInternal is replaced with
  ContentHandler::getSlotDiffRendererWithOptions. This breaks consumers which
  call parent::getSlotDiffRendererInternal (no instances of which are known).
* TextContent::getHighlightHtml, deprecated since 1.24, has been removed. Use
  TextContent::getHtml instead.
* ExtensionRegistry::load(), deprecated in 1.34, was removed.

  "apc" entry in $wgObjectCaches now refers to APCUBagOStuff.
* Database::bufferResults(), deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* CannotReplaceActiveServiceException, ContainerDisabledException,
  DestructibleService, NoSuchServiceException, SalvageableService,

  the MediaWiki\\Services namespace instead.
* The following methods in the Interwiki class were removed: ::fetch(),
  ::isValidInterwiki(), ::invalidateCache(), and ::getAllPrefixes().
* The UsersMultiselectWidget config 'allowArbitrary' is now false by default. To
  accept arbitrary entries, pass in true for this config.
* OutputPage::parse() and OutputPage::parseInline(), deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed.  Use ::parseAsContent() or ::parseAsInterface(), as
  appropriate.
* ContentHandler::makeParserOptions(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed. Use
  WikiPage::makeParserOptions() or ParserOptions::newCanonical() instead.
* WikiPage::selectFields, deprecated in 1.31, was removed. Use ::getQueryInfo.
* The remaining static methods for MagicWord, deprecated in 1.32, were removed.
  These were MagicWord::get(), ::getSubstIDs(), ::getDoubleUnderscoreArray(),
  ::getVariableIDs(), and ::getCacheTTL(). Instead, use MagicWordFactory (via
  MediaWikiServices).
* ApiBase::checkTitleUserPermissions no longer accepts a User as the third
  parameter. Passing a user was deprecated in 1.33.
* Sanitizer::setupAttributeWhitelist() and Sanitizer::attributeWhitelist(),
  deprecated in 1.34, have been removed.  They should not have been public.
* The ParserAfterUnstrip hook was removed without deprecation.
* Preprocessor_DOM and related classes, deprecated in 1.34, have been removed.
* ParserOptions::getMaxGeneratedPPNodeCount() and ::setMaxGeneratedPPNodeCount()
  have been removed without deprecation.
* The support for old signature for ParserFactory::__construct was deprecated in
  1.34 and now has been removed.
* SpecialRecentChanges::filterByCategories(), deprecated in 1.31, was removed.
* The `ArticleContentViewCustom` hook, deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
* AuthManager::callLegacyAuthPlugin, deprecated in 1.33, was removed.
* wfGetMessageCacheStorage was removed without deprecation.
* Title::moveSubpages, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. Use the MovePage class
  and MovePage::moveSubpages instead.
* Article::doEditContent, deprecated in 1.29, was removed. Instead, use
  WikiPage::doEditContent.
* CommentStore::newKey, deprecated in 1.31, was removed.
* Title::isValidMoveOperation, ::moveTo, and ::isValidMoveTarget, deprecated
  in 1.25, were removed. Use the MovePage class and its methods instead.
* Title::getUserCaseDBKey(), deprecated in 1.33, was removed. Use ::getDBkey().
* StringUtils::explodeMarkup() was removed without deprecation.
* AjaxResponse methods that were unused have been removed without deprecation:
  - checkLastModified
  - loadFromMemcached
  - storeInMemcached
  - setCacheDuration
  - setVary
* ApiDelete::delete and ::deleteFile, both of which were protected methods,
  have been made private to allow a signature change.
* Skin::getSkinNameMessages() deprecated in 1.34, has been removed.
* Skin::escapeSearchLink() deprecated in 1.34, has been removed, use
  Skin::getSearchLink() instead.
* Revision::loadFromId and RevisionStore::loadRevisionFromId have been
  removed.
* OutputPage::parserOptions doesn't accept an $options parameter anymore.
* MessageCache::getParserOptions previously did not have a visibility set.
  It has been made private.
* The Skin no longer loads the "mediawiki.legacy.shared" or
  "mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint" modules. The legacy shared styles must now
  be loaded by the skin explicitly, either inherited via the
  "mediawiki.skinning.*" modules, or by making your skin's main styles
  module use the ResourceLoaderSkinModule class with the "legacy" attribute.
  See Vector and Monobook for examples.
* Passing an ApiMain to the constructor of ApiResult is no longer supported.
  This was deprecated in 1.25.
* The ArticleAfterFetchContentObject hook, deprecated in 1.32, was removed.
  Use ArticleRevisionViewCustom to control output.
* HTMLUserTextField and HTMLUsersMultiselectField previously implied
  required=true when exists=true. Form fields that use exists=true should also
  set required=true if they are required.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.35 ===
* The PHPUnit4And6Compat class, used to provide compatibility with PHPUnit 4, is
  now deprecated. MediaWiki support for PHPUnit 4 ended with the removal of HHVM
  support.
* Revision::getRevisionText(), deprecated in 1.32, now emits deprecation alerts.
* LockManagerGroup::getDefault() and LockManagerGroup::getAny() are deprecated.
  They seem to be unused. Just use get() directly, and catch any exception.
* AbstractBlock::getPermissionsError and AbstractBlock::getBlockErrorParams are
  deprecated. Use BlockErrorFormatter::getMessage instead.
* The IP class is deprecated. Please instead use the Wikimedia\IPUtils class
  from the new wikimedia/ip-utils library instead. Additionally, the RE_IP_*
  constants are also deprecated. RE_IP_BYTE can be replaced with a class
  constant on the IPUtils class, while the others will eventually be made
  private.
* The following Language methods are deprecated: getFallbackFor,
  getFallbacksFor, getFallbacksIncludingSiteLanguage. Use the corresponding new
  methods on the LanguageFallback class: getFirst, getAll, and
  getAllIncludingSiteLanguage.
* FileJournal::factory is deprecated. Use the constructor directly instead.
* AbstractBlock methods setBlocker(), getBlocker() are deprecated and will
  become internal implementation of DatabaseBlock.
* Title::countRevisionsBetween has been deprecated and moved into RevisionStore.
* FileBackendGroup::singleton() is deprecated. Use MediaWikiServices instead.
* FileBackendGroup::destroySingleton() is deprecated. Test frameworks should
  instead reset MediaWikiServices between test runs.
  (MediaWikiIntegrationTestCase does this automatically.)
* MediaWikiIntegrationTest::setContentLang() has been deprecated. Use
  setMwGlobals( 'wgLanguageCode', 'xxx' ) to set a different site language
  code, or setService( 'ContentLanguage', $myObj ) to set a specific Language
  object. Service resets and $wgContLang will be handled automatically.
* MediaWikiIntegrationTest::assertType() has been deprecated, as part of the
  work to move to PHPUnit 8; PHPUnit's assertInternalType() was deprecated, and
  will be removed in PHPUnit 9. MediaWikiIntegrationTest::assertTypeOrValue(),
  a wrapper for assertType(), has been removed immediately, without deprecation.
* AbstractBlock::getReason is deprecated, since reasons are actually stored as
  CommentStoreComments, and getReason returns a string with no caller control
  over language or formatting. Instead use AbstractBlock::getReasonComment,
  which returns the CommentStoreComment.
* The global function wfGetRusage() is deprecated and will now always call the
  getrusage() function without checking for its existence.
* The properties User::mBlock, User::mBlockedby and User::mHideName are
  deprecated. Instead, use User::getBlock to get the block, then use
  AbstractBlock::getByName or AbstractBlock::getHideName.Use the GetUserBlock
  hook to set, unset or modify a block, including hiding or unhiding a user.
* Language::factory() and Language::getParentLanguage() are deprecated, and so
  is directly calling the Language constructor. Use the new LanguageFactory
  class instead.
* Language::classFromCode() is deprecated. There is no reason it should be used
  outside the Language class itself.
* Language::clearCaches() is deprecated. Instead, reset all services and set
  Language::$mLangObjCache = [].
* The following functions from Language class are deprecated in favour of
  respective functions in LanguageConverter:
  - autoConvert
  - autoConvertToAllVariants
  - convert
  - convertTitle
  - convertNamespace
  - hasVariants
  - hasVariant
  - convertHtml
  - convertCategoryKey
  - getVariants
  - getPreferredVariant
  - getURLVariant
  - findVariantLink
  - getExtraHashOptions
  - updateConversionTable
* Language::classFromCode() is hard deprecated and should be removed in 1.36
* Language::getConverter() is deprecated and should be removed in 1.36
* Language::MESSAGES_FALLBACKS, Language::STRICT_FALLBACKS were deprecated.
  Use LanguageFallback::MESSAGES and LanguageFallback::STRICT respectively
* Language::$mLangObjCache is deprecated and should be removed in 1.36. Use
  MediaWikiServices instead to get a LanguageFactory.
* Language::getMessagesFor(), getMessageFor(), and getMessageKeysFor() are
  deprecated. Use LocalisationCache's getItem(), getSubitem(), and
  getSubitemList() methods directly.
* OutputPage::getCSPNonce() is deprecated, use OutputPage::getCSP()->getNonce()
  instead.
* Skin::makeI18nUrl() and makeNSUrl() have been deprecated, no longer used.
* Title::countAuthorsBetween and Title::getAuthorsBetween have been deprecated.
  Use respective methods in RevisionStore instead.
* Remove deprecated SkinCopyrightFooter &$forContent parameter
* The following Language class static variables have been replaced with
  constants and deprecated: $mWeekdayMsgs, $mWeekdayAbbrevMsgs, $mMonthMsgs,
  $mMonthGenMsgs, $mMonthAbbrevMsgs, $mIranianCalendarMonthMsgs,
  $mHebrewCalendarMonthMsgs, $mHebrewCalendarMonthGenMsgs,
  $mHijriCalendarMonthMsgs and $durationIntervals.
* As part of dropping security support for IE 6 and IE 7,
  WebRequest::checkUrlExtension() has been deprecated, and now always returns
  true.
* The following ApiBase::PARAM_* constants have been deprecated in favor of
  equivalent ParamValidator constants: PARAM_DFLT, PARAM_ISMULTI, PARAM_TYPE,
  PARAM_MAX, PARAM_MAX2, PARAM_MIN, PARAM_ALLOW_DUPLICATES, PARAM_DEPRECATED,
  PARAM_REQUIRED, PARAM_SUBMODULE_MAP, PARAM_SUBMODULE_PARAM_PREFIX, PARAM_ALL,
  PARAM_EXTRA_NAMESPACES, PARAM_SENSITIVE, PARAM_DEPRECATED_VALUES,
  PARAM_ISMULTI_LIMIT1, PARAM_ISMULTI_LIMIT2, PARAM_MAX_BYTES, PARAM_MAX_CHARS.
* ApiBase::explodeMultiValue() is deprecated. Use
  ParamValidator::explodeMultiValue() instead.
* ApiBase::parseMultiValue() is deprecated. No replacement is provided;
  generally this sort of thing should be handled by fully validating the
  parameter.
* ApiBase::validateLimit() and ApiBase::validateTimestamp() are deprecated.
