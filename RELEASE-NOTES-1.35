== MediaWiki 1.35.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.35 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
1.35 has several database changes since 1.34, and will not work without schema
updates. Note that due to changes to some very large tables like the revision
table, the schema update may take quite long (minutes on a medium sized site,
many hours on a large site).

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed upgrade instructions, including
important information when upgrading from versions prior to 1.11.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.35 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.34.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.35 ===

…

==== New configuration ====
* $wgDiffEngine can be used to specify the difference engine to use, rather
  than choosing the first of $wgExternalDiffEngine, wikidiff2, or php that
  is usable.
* $wgSearchMatchRedirectPreference – This configuration setting controls whether
  users can set a new preference, search-match-redirect, which decides if search
  should redirect them to exact matches is available. By default, this is set to
  false, which maintains the previous behaviour without preference bloat. Change
  your site's default by setting $wgDefaultUserOptions['search-match-redirect'].
* Per-user concurrency in SpecialContributions can now be limited by setting
  $wgPoolCounterConf['SpecialContributions'] appropriately.
* Added new PasswordPolicyCheck: PasswordCannotBeSubstringInUsername.  Similar
  to the existing PasswordCannotMatchUsername check, this check ensures that
  a user's (case-insensitive) password cannot be a part of their username.
  e.g. password = MyPassword, username = ThisUsersPasswordIsMyPassword.
* $wgLogos – This new configuration setting combines the now-deprecated $wgLogo
  and $wgLogoHD settings into a single, associative array. It provides support
  for key 'svg' mapping to the path of the wiki's logo in vector form, alongside
  the existing support provided by the legacy settings: '1x' mapping to the path
  of the logo as a 135x135px raster image (equivalent to $wgLogo), and '1.5x',
  '2x', and 'wordmark' operating as before. If $wgLogos is unset, $wgLogo and
  $wgLogoHD values are read for backwards compatibility. (T232140)
* …

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgResourceLoaderMaxage (T235314) - This configuration array controls the
  max-age for HTTP caching through the Cache-Control header. It has uses the
  "versioned" key for urls that do have a version parameter, and the
  "unversioned" key for urls without a version parameter. The sub keys for
  "client" and "server" are no longer supported in MediaWiki 1.35.
* $wgEnableOpenSearchSuggest - This boolean variable is deprecated and no longer
  used. The OpenSearch API is now always enabled.
* …

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgSysopEmailBans — This setting, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. To let
  sysops block email access, use $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['blockemail'].
* $wgDBWindowsAuthentication — This setting had no effect anymore after support
  for SQL Server was removed in 1.34. (T230418)
* $wgProfileOnly — This setting, deprecated in 1.23, was removed. The log
  file should instead be set using $wgDebugLogGroups['profileoutput'].
* $wgSkipSkin - This setting, deprecated in 1.23, was removed. To disable a
  skin from being shown, use $wgSkipSkins.
* $wgMaxGeneratedPPNodeCount - This setting was removed.  It only affected
  Preprocessor_DOM, which was deprecated in 1.34 and removed in this release.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.35 ===
* (T204618) Whitelisted the aria-hidden HTML attribute for all elements in
  wikitext.
* (T13456) Special:EditPage, Special:PageHistory, Special:PageInfo, and
  Special:Purge have been created as shortcuts for each action.
  Special:EditPage/Foo redirects to title=foo&action=edit, with PageHistory,
  PageInfo, and Purge corresponding to action= history, info, and purge
  respectively. When linked to, its subpage is used as the target. Otherwise,
  it displays a basic interface to allow the end user to specify the target
  manually.
* (T139221) The generated table of contents is now a navigation landmark role
  for assistive technologies.
* …

=== New developer features in 1.35 ===
* If CSP is enabled, extensions can now add additional sources using the
  ContentSecurityPolicy::addDefaultSource, ::addStyleSrc and ::addScriptSrc
  methods (e.g. $context->getOutput()->getCSP()->addDefaultSrc( 'example.com' ))
* Extensions can now specify classes and namespaces to be autoloaded by the
  test autoloader, by setting the "TestAutoloadNamespaces" and
  "TestAutoloadClasses" properties in extension.json. (T196090)
* Added getters for OutputPage's robot, index and follow policies;
  getRobotPolicy() returns the entire policy as a string in the form
  <index policy>,<follow policy> while getIndexPolicy() and getFollowPolicy()
  return their respective policies as a string.
* The ResourceLoaderSiteModulePages and ResourceLoaderSiteStylesModulePages
  hooks were added to allow changing which wiki pages these modules contain.
* ContentHandlerFactory for most ContentHandler static methods. It has been
  added to the constructors for many classes to improve SOLID / GRASP.
* …

* …

==== New external libraries ====
* Added doctrine/dbal 2.9.3 (dev-only).
* Added wikimedia/ip-utils 1.0.0.

* …

==== Removed external libraries ====
* phpunit/php-invoker (dev-only).
  Removing this unbreaks development on Windows systems, in exchange for losing
  time limits in running unit tests.
* …

=== Bug fixes in 1.35 ===
* …

=== Action API changes in 1.35 ===
* The 'suggest' parameter of action=opensearch has been deprecated.
  The API behaves the same with and without this parameter.
  It was previously used by $wgEnableOpenSearchSuggest to partially
  disable the API if set to false. Specifically, it would deny internal
  frontend requests carrying this parameter, whilst accepting other requests.
* Integer-type parameters are now validated for syntax rather than being
  interpreted in surprising ways. For example, the following will now return a
  badinteger error:
  * "1.9" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * " 1" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * "1e1" (formerly interpreted as "1" or "10", depending on the PHP version)
  * "1foobar" (formerly interpreted as "1")
  * "foobar" (formerly intepreted as "0")
* Error codes for many parameter validation failures are changing.
* action=paraminfo no longer returns "enforcerange" for numeric-typed
  parameters. Ranges should be assumed to be enforced.
* Many user-type parameters now accept a user ID, formatted like "#12345".
* …

=== Action API internal changes in 1.35 ===
* The Action API now uses the Wikimedia\ParamValidator library for parameter
  validation, which brings some new features and changes. For the most part
  existing module code should work as it did before, but see subsequent notes
  for changes.
  * The values for all ApiBase PARAM_* constants have changed. Code should have
    been using the constants rather than hard-coding the values.
  * Several ApiBase PARAM_* constants have been deprecated, see the in-class
    documentation for details. Use the equivalent ParamValidator constants
    instead.
  * The value returned for 'upload'-type parameters has changed from
    WebRequestUpload to Psr\Http\Message\UploadedFileInterface.
* Validation of 'user'-type parameters is more flexible. PARAM constants exist
  to specify the type of "user" allowed and to request UserIdentity objects
  rather than name strings. The default is to accept all types (name, IP,
  range, and interwiki) that were formerly accepted.
* Maximum limits are no longer ignored in "internal mode".
* The $paramName to ApiBase::handleParamNormalization() should now include the
  prefix.
* …

=== Languages updated in 1.35 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.35 ===

  CONSTRUCTOR_OPTIONS. This was a breaking change made without deprecation.
* ObjectCache::getWANInstance, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Use MediaWikiServices::getMainWANObjectCache instead.
* ObjectCache::newWANCacheFromParams, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.

* (T231366) The ProfilerOutputDb class and profileinfo.php entry point,
  deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
* ApiQueryUserInfo::getBlockInfo, deprecated in 1.34, was removed. Use
  ApiBlockInfoTrait::getBlockDetails instead.

    isValidHalfParsedText(), and StripState::getSubState() and
    StripState::merge(), all deprecated in 1.31. The helper functions
    LinkHolderArray::mergeForeign() and LinkHolderArray::getSubArray()
    were also removed.
  - getConverterLanguage(), deprecated in 1.32. Use getTargetLanguage() instead.

    - createAssocArgs()
    - doAllQuotes()
    - doDoubleUnderscore()
    - doHeadings()
    - doMagicLinks()

  This use pattern was deprecated in 1.34.
* MediaWikiTestCase::prepareServices(), deprecated in 1.32, has been removed
* The method ContentHandler::getSlotDiffRendererInternal is replaced with
  ContentHandler::getSlotDiffRendererWithOptions. This breaks consumers which
  call parent::getSlotDiffRendererInternal (no instances of which are known).

  TextContent::getHtml instead.
* ExtensionRegistry::load(), deprecated in 1.34, was removed.
  Use ::queue() instead.
* MWMessagePack class, deprecated in 1.34, was removed.

  for HHVM was dropped) and these versions of PHP only support apcu. The default
  "apc" entry in $wgObjectCaches now refers to APCUBagOStuff.
* CannotReplaceActiveServiceException, ContainerDisabledException,
  DestructibleService, NoSuchServiceException, SalvageableService,
  ServiceAlreadyDefinedException, ServiceContainer and ServiceDisabledException
  in the global namespace, deprecated in 1.33, were removed. Use the classes in

* The UsersMultiselectWidget config 'allowArbitrary' is now false by default. To
  accept arbitrary entries, pass in true for this config.
* OutputPage::parse() and OutputPage::parseInline(), deprecated in 1.32, have
  been removed.  Use ::parseAsContent() or ::parseAsInterface(), as
  appropriate.
* ContentHandler::makeParserOptions(), deprecated in 1.32, was removed. Use
  WikiPage::makeParserOptions() or ParserOptions::newCanonical() instead.
* The remaining static methods for MagicWord, deprecated in 1.32, were removed.
  These were MagicWord::get(), ::getSubstIDs(), ::getDoubleUnderscoreArray(),
  ::getVariableIDs(), and ::getCacheTTL(). Instead, use MagicWordFactory (via
  MediaWikiServices).
* ApiBase::checkTitleUserPermissions no longer accepts a User as the third
  parameter. Passing a user was deprecated in 1.33.
* Sanitizer::setupAttributeWhitelist() and Sanitizer::attributeWhitelist(),
  deprecated in 1.34, have been removed.  They should not have been public.
* The ParserAfterUnstrip hook was removed without deprecation.
* Preprocessor_DOM and related classes, deprecated in 1.34, have been removed.

  1.34 and now has been removed.
* SpecialRecentChanges::filterByCategories(), deprecated in 1.31, was removed
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.35 ===
* The PHPUnit4And6Compat class, used to provide compatibility with PHPUnit 4, is
  now deprecated. MediaWiki support for PHPUnit 4 ended with the removal of HHVM
  support.
* Revision::getRevisionText(), deprecated in 1.32, now emits deprecation alerts.
* LockManagerGroup::getDefault() and LockManagerGroup::getAny() are deprecated.
  They seem to be unused. Just use get() directly, and catch any exception.
* AbstractBlock::getPermissionsError and AbstractBlock::getBlockErrorParams are
  deprecated. Use BlockErrorFormatter::getMessage instead.
* The IP class is deprecated. Please instead use the Wikimedia\IPUtils class
  from the new wikimedia/ip-utils library instead. Additionally, the RE_IP_*
  constants are also deprecated. RE_IP_BYTE can be replaced with a class
  constant on the IPUtils class, while the others will eventually be made
  private.
* The following Language methods are deprecated: getFallbackFor,
  getFallbacksFor, getFallbacksIncludingSiteLanguage. Use the corresponding new
  methods on the LanguageFallback class: getFirst, getAll, and
  getAllIncludingSiteLanguage.
* FileJournal::factory is deprecated. Use the constructor directly instead.
* AbstractBlock methods setBlocker(), getBlocker() are deprecated and will
  become internal implementation of DatabaseBlock.
* Title::countRevisionsBetween has been deprecated and moved into RevisionStore.
* FileBackendGroup::singleton() is deprecated. Use MediaWikiServices instead.
* FileBackendGroup::destroySingleton() is deprecated. Test frameworks should
  instead reset MediaWikiServices between test runs.
  (MediaWikiIntegrationTestCase does this automatically.)
* MediaWikiIntegrationTest::setContentLang() has been deprecated. Use
  setMwGlobals( 'wgLanguageCode', 'xxx' ) to set a different site language
  code, or setService( 'ContentLanguage', $myObj ) to set a specific Language
  object. Service resets and $wgContLang will be handled automatically.
* MediaWikiIntegrationTest::assertType() has been deprecated, as part of the
  work to move to PHPUnit 8; PHPUnit's assertInternalType() was deprecated, and
  will be removed in PHPUnit 9. MediaWikiIntegrationTest::assertTypeOrValue(),
  a wrapper for assertType(), has been removed immediately, without deprecation.
* AbstractBlock::getReason is deprecated, since reasons are actually stored as
  CommentStoreComments, and getReason returns a string with no caller control
  over language or formatting. Instead use AbstractBlock::getReasonComment,
  which returns the CommentStoreComment.
* The global function wfGetRusage() is deprecated and will now always call the
  getrusage() function without checking for its existence.
* The properties User::mBlock, User::mBlockedby and User::mHideName are
  deprecated. Instead, use User::getBlock to get the block, then use
  AbstractBlock::getByName or AbstractBlock::getHideName.Use the GetUserBlock
  hook to set, unset or modify a block, including hiding or unhiding a user.
* Language::factory() and Language::getParentLanguage() are deprecated, and so
  is directly calling the Language constructor. Use the new LanguageFactory
  class instead.
* Language::classFromCode() is deprecated. There is no reason it should be used
  outside the Language class itself.
* Language::clearCaches() is deprecated. Instead, reset all services and set
  Language::$mLangObjCache = [].
* The following functions from Language class are deprecated in favour of
  respective functions in LanguageConverter:
  - autoConvert
  - autoConvertToAllVariants
  - convert
  - convertTitle
  - convertNamespace
  - hasVariants
  - hasVariant
  - convertHtml
  - convertCategoryKey
  - getVariants
  - getPreferredVariant
  - getURLVariant
  - findVariantLink
  - getExtraHashOptions
  - updateConversionTable
* Language::classFromCode() is hard deprecated and should be removed in 1.36
* Language::getConverter() is deprecated and should be removed in 1.36
* Language::MESSAGES_FALLBACKS, Language::STRICT_FALLBACKS were deprecated.
  Use LanguageFallback::MESSAGES and LanguageFallback::STRICT respectively
* Language::$mLangObjCache is deprecated and should be removed in 1.36. Use
  MediaWikiServices instead to get a LanguageFactory.
* Language::getMessagesFor(), getMessageFor(), and getMessageKeysFor() are
  deprecated. Use LocalisationCache's getItem(), getSubitem(), and
  getSubitemList() methods directly.
* OutputPage::getCSPNonce() is deprecated, use OutputPage::getCSP()->getNonce()
  instead.
* Skin::makeI18nUrl() and makeNSUrl() have been deprecated, no longer used.
* Title::countAuthorsBetween and Title::getAuthorsBetween have been deprecated.
  Use respective methods in RevisionStore instead.
* Remove deprecated SkinCopyrightFooter &$forContent parameter
* The following Language class static variables have been replaced with
  constants and deprecated: $mWeekdayMsgs, $mWeekdayAbbrevMsgs, $mMonthMsgs,
  $mMonthGenMsgs, $mMonthAbbrevMsgs, $mIranianCalendarMonthMsgs,
  $mHebrewCalendarMonthMsgs, $mHebrewCalendarMonthGenMsgs,
  $mHijriCalendarMonthMsgs and $durationIntervals.
* As part of dropping security support for IE 6 and IE 7,
  WebRequest::checkUrlExtension() has been deprecated, and now always returns
  true.
* The following ApiBase::PARAM_* constants have been deprecated in favor of
  equivalent ParamValidator constants: PARAM_DFLT, PARAM_ISMULTI, PARAM_TYPE,
  PARAM_MAX, PARAM_MAX2, PARAM_MIN, PARAM_ALLOW_DUPLICATES, PARAM_DEPRECATED,
  PARAM_REQUIRED, PARAM_SUBMODULE_MAP, PARAM_SUBMODULE_PARAM_PREFIX, PARAM_ALL,
  PARAM_EXTRA_NAMESPACES, PARAM_SENSITIVE, PARAM_DEPRECATED_VALUES,
  PARAM_ISMULTI_LIMIT1, PARAM_ISMULTI_LIMIT2, PARAM_MAX_BYTES, PARAM_MAX_CHARS.
* ApiBase::explodeMultiValue() is deprecated. Use
  ParamValidator::explodeMultiValue() instead.
* ApiBase::parseMultiValue() is deprecated. No replacement is provided;
  generally this sort of thing should be handled by fully validating the
  parameter.
* ApiBase::validateLimit() and ApiBase::validateTimestamp() are deprecated.
  Use ApiParamValidator::validateValue() with an appropriate settings array
  instead.
* ContentHandler (use ContentHandlerFactory):
  - getForTitle
  - getForContent
  - getForModelID
  - getContentModels
  - getAllContentFormats
  - protected $handler (not need anymore)
  - cleanupHandlersCache (not need anymore)
* $wgMemc is deprecated, use
  MediaWikiServices::getInstance()->getLocalServerObjectCache() instead.
* ImagePage::getImageLimitsFromOptions() is deprecated. Use static function
  MediaFileTrait::getImageLimitsFromOptions() instead.
* A number of Parser-related methods were deprecated to simplify the API or
  because they will not be supported in the upcoming parser replacement:
  - doBlockLevels() (and BlockLevelPass class has been marked @internal)
  - setFunctionTagHook()
  - attributeStripCallback()
  - fetchTemplate() - use Parser::fetchTemplateAndTitle() instead.
* The signature of DefaultPreferencesFactory::__construct has been changed:
  - LanguageConverter $languageConverter has been added.
  and its usage with old arguments is hard deprecated.
* The public usage of the following properties of LanguageConverter have been
  deprecated as there is no reason they should be used outside the
  LanguageConverter class and will be changed from public to private:
  - mLangObj
  - mUcfirst
  - mConvRuleTitle
  - mURLVariant
  - mUserVariant
  - mHeaderVariant
  - mMaxDepth
  - mVarSeparatorPattern
  changed from public to protected:
  - mTables
* The ArticleEditUpdatesDeleteFromRecentchanges hook has been deprecated. Please
  use the RecentChange_save hook or similar instead.
* …
