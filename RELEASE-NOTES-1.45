== MediaWiki 1.45.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.45 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.45 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.45 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.44.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.45 ===

* $wgPHPSessionHandling is now deprecated, and the default value has
  been changed to 'warn'. Any extension that uses PHP session handling
  ($_SESSION, session_start(), etc.) will cause warnings to be emitted.
  Migration instructions:
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:SessionManager_and_AuthManager/Updating_tips#SessionManager
  Known affected extensions:
  https://codesearch.wmcloud.org/things/?q=\%24_SESSION|\ssession_\w%2B\s*\(&files=\.php%24

  Integration with PHP session handling will be removed in the future, making
  PHP session handling and MediaWiki session handling independent. Using PHP
  session handling may cause conflicts with the cookies used by MediaWiki.

  To silence the warnings and restore previous behavior,
  use `$wgPHPSessionHandling = 'enable';`.
  This configuration setting will be removed in a future release.

  To silence the warnings and disable integration with PHP session handling,
  use `define( 'MW_NO_SESSION_HANDLER', 1 );`.
  This constant will always be defined in a future release.

* $wgSitemapNamespacesPriorities is deprecated and ignored.
* $wgCSPUploadEntryPoint to control if img_auth.php & thumb.php send CSP headers
* $wgEnableProtectionIndicators is now enabled by default.
  If your community already uses protection indicators you might want to disable
  this setting, or customize them with site CSS.
* …

==== New configuration ====

* (T389281) $wgUseLeximorph - Defaults to false. When enabled, core parser
  functions for grammar, plural, gender, formality, and bidi use the
  Leximorph library’s modular handlers instead of the legacy Language methods.
  When disabled, the legacy methods are used.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====

* (T402094) $wgReauthenticateTime now defaults to 3600 seconds instead of 60
  seconds (1 minute to 1 hour) to improve the user experience

==== Removed configuration ====

* (T13555, T371756) $wgParserEnableLegacyHeadingDOM was removed.
  The skin option 'supportsMwHeading' was likewise removed.
  New heading markup is now always enabled, on all skins.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
* (T387856) $wgEnotifImpersonal and $wgEnotifMaxRecips, deprecated in 1.44,
  are no longer honoured.
* (T394054) $wgParserEnableLegacyMediaDOM and $wgUseContentMediaStyles
  were removed.  New media markup is now always enabled.  More information:

  controls the database schema migration for the categorylinks table, has been
  removed.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.45 ===

* (T219543) [[Special:SpecialPages]], the index of special pages, now has
  a search box that filters the list.
* (T118132) After using [[Special:MergeHistory]] to merge page histories,
  [[Special:Log]] will show entries for both the source and the destination
  page. Previously, the merge was only logged for the source page.
* (T384578) Attempting to create a redirect to an invalid target, such as
  Special:UserLogout, will now result in a warning.
* (T280531) Partial action blocks is now enabled by default. This feature
  allows administrators to block users from performing certain actions (such
  as moving pages) without blocking them from editing pages.
* (T328254) A new parser function has been added, {{#contentmodel}}, which
  returns the localized name of the contentmodel of the current page.  This
  is primarily meant for use in system messages.
* …

* The new built-in notifications framework is now stable for use by extensions.
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Notifications
* The Status and StatusValue classes can now be documented as generic classes
  with a type parameter for their value. These annotations allow IDEs and
  static analysis tools to better understand the types in code such as:
      /** @return StatusValue<Foo> */
      function doStuff(): StatusValue { ... }
      doStuff()->getValue()->bar();
* The SpecialUserRightsChangeableGroupsHook hook was added.

  User::getInvalidationTokenUrl() methods were added.

  central IDs.
* SessionManager::getJwtData() has been added, to standardize JWT format
  for session providers which use a JWT.
* The JwtCodec service has been added, for encoding/decoding JWTs.
* The LeximorphFactory service was added.
* (T402154) MessagePostProcessText and MessagePostProcessHtml hooks were added.
* (T396889) In the past, messages that have to exist for technical
  reason but shouldn't be translated, were added to the usual
  en.json and qqq.json files, and then configured as 'ignored' in translatewiki.
  From now on, such messages should be added to the en.json and qqq.json file
  under nontranslatable/.
* …

* Reading parser cache content using native PHP serialization has been

  $wgParserCacheUseJson=false should either clear the parser cache, or
  upgrade to revision 1.36-1.44 with $wgParserCacheUseJson=true and
  wait until the parser cache expiration time
  ($wgParserCacheExpireTime) elapses before upgrading to this release.

  <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Parser_cache/Serialization_compatibility>
