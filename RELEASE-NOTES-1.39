* The DBPrimaryPos class alias 'DBMasterPos' has been removed.
* Passing a db to BlockRestrictionStore::loadByBlockId() is no longer supported.
  BlockRestrictionStoreFactory should be used to fetch a correct

* EventRelayerKafka, deprecated in 1.38, was removed.
* MediaWiki\Logger\Monolog\KafkaHandler, deprecated in 1.38, was removed.
* The global function wfWikiID(), deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
* Database::wasKnownStatementRollbackError() was removed. Subclasses should
  override isKnownStatementRollbackError() instead.
* Database::wasQueryTimeoutError() was removed. Subclasses should
  override isQueryTimeoutError() instead.
* Changes to ResourceLoader modules:
  - The mediawiki.viewport module, deprecated in 1.37 has been
     removed. Use IntersectionObserver instead.
* Use of the SiteStatsUpdate constructor has been deprecated in favor of
  the ::factory() method.
* Changes to skins:
  - Skin::makeSearchButton and Skin::makeSearchInput were deprecated in 1.38.
    Use SkinTemplate methods with the same name or Skin::getTemplateData
    instead.

    deprecated in 1.37, will no longer ship any styles.
  - Skin::getSkinStylePath, deprecated since 1.36, has been removed.

* …

=== Deprecations in 1.39 ===
* PageProps::getInstance(), deprecated since 1.38, emits deprecations warnings.
* SpecialRedirectWithAction::__construct without SearchEngineFactory argument
  is hard deprecated.
* The following global functions are deprecated in favor of the listed UrlUtils
  methods.
  - wfExpandUrl -> UrlUtils::expand
  - wfGetServerUrl -> UrlUtils::getServer
  - wfAssembleUrl -> UrlUtils::assemble
  - wfRemoveDotSegments -> UrlUtils::removeDotSegments
  - wfUrlProtocols -> UrlUtils::validProtocols
  - wfUrlProtocolsWithoutProtRel -> UrlUtils::validAbsoluteProtocols
  - wfParseUrl -> UrlUtils::parse

  These methods are exact replacements except that
  1) they return null instead of false or empty string on error (where
     applicable);
  2) UrlUtils::validProtocols does not take a parameter (documentation said not
     to pass one to wfUrlProtocols anyway);
  3) they use type hints (don't try passing null instead of string, etc.).
