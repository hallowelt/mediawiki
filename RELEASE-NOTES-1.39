=== Languages updated in 1.39 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T307080) Added language support for Okinawan (ryu).
* (T307887) Added language support for Mooré (mos).
* (T304920) In Swahili, The "Media" namespace is now "Media", as in English,
  and the "File" namespace is now "Faili". The old name of the "File" namespace
  was "Picha", and it's kept for backwards compatibility. If you manage a wiki
  in Swahili, and you use "Faili:" as a namespace anywhere in wikitext, and
  you mean to use it as "Media:", these need to be replaced to "Media:".
* …

    Skins using SkinTemplate must set bodyOnly as a skin option and
    remove lines of code generating html, body and head elements.

    Use SkinTemplate methods with the same name or Skin::getTemplateData
    instead.

    been removed in favor of Html class methods.

  given null. Previously it did nothing if given null.
* The default value for the first argument to the ParserOutput constructor
  is now null instead of ''.

     to pass one to wfUrlProtocols anyway);
