=== Languages updated in 1.39 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T307080) Added language support for Okinawan (ryu).
* (T304920) In Swahili, The "Media" namespace is now "Media", as in English,
  and the "File" namespace is now "Faili". The old name of the "File" namespace
  was "Picha", and it's kept for backwards compatibility. If you manage a wiki
  in Swahili, and you use "Faili:" as a namespace anywhere in wikitext, and
  you mean to use it as "Media:", these need to be replaced to "Media:".
* …
