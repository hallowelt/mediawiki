=== New user-facing features in 1.37 ===
* All HTML5 named entities are now accepted in wikitext.
* Logo of MediaWiki has changed. This changes the "Powered By MediaWiki" button.
* …

=== New developer features in 1.37 ===
* Parser test files can now declare a dependency on a specific extension being
  loaded, not just on the presence of a certain extension tag hook. This is a
  better fit for extensions like TimedMediaHandler, which affect the output but
  don't register parser hooks. Use `extension:Foo` in  the `!! hooks` section of
  your parser test file to declare a dependency on the `Foo` extension being
  loaded.
* To expose code previously present in SpecialBlock/SpecialUnblock to other
  parts of the code, or to extensions, the new BlockUser and UnblockUser command
  objects were added. Use the BlockUserFactory and UnblockUserFactory services
  to create them.
* The hook UsersPagerDoBatchLookupsHook takes now a \Wikimedia\Rdbms\IDatabase,
  instead of \Wikimedia\Rdbms\DBConnRef, as the first parameter.
* MediaHandlers can now customize the formatting of the metadata they emit by
  over-riding MediaHandler::formatTag( $key, $value ). The default for unknown
  tags is numeric formatting; non-EXIF tags which are non-numeric should always
  use this method to specify the desired formatting.
* The new 'title' type can be used to validate action API and REST API inputs.
* The new ArticleParserOptions hook allows customizing the parser options used
  to parse wikitext for an article, based on user preferences, title, etc.
* The new 'raw' type can be used to validate action API inputs. It bypasses the
  Unicode NFC normalization done on inputs of type 'string', so it more suitable
  when the input is binary or may contain deprecated Unicode sequences or
  characters (such as U+2001) that should be passed unmodified.
* (T260330) A new abstraction for running shell commands has been introduced,
  called BoxedCommand. A BoxedCommand object can be obtained with
  MediaWikiServices::getInstance()->getCommandFactory()->createBoxed().
* ResourceLoader modules can now mark themselves as ES6-only by setting
  `'es6' => true` in their module definition. ES6-only modules will not be
  executed in browsers that don't support ES6, such as IE11.
