* MediaWiki's virtualrest internal library has been removed in favor of the
  HTTP library like: Guzzle, MultiHttpClient or MwHttpRequest.
* Several deprecated methods have been removed from the Content interface,
  in favor of the respective methods in ContentHandlers. Callers should
  use a more narrow interface like ContentRenderer or ContentTransformer
  when possible. The following methods have been removed from Content:
  - getParserOutput()
  - preSaveTransform()
  - preloadTransform()
  - prepareSave()

  known users of it. Its old behavior has been deprecated and will change
  in the future without further notice.
* MediaWikiIntegrationTestCase::$tablesUsed has been deprecated. The framework
  now detects these automatically.

* …

=== Deprecations in 1.42 ===
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.

  In this release of MediaWiki, XYZ classes now have a namespace and XYZ do
  not yet (XYZ% done, up from 63% in MediaWiki 1.41.0). The following have newly
  been moved:
  - MediaWiki\Deferred:
    - AtomicSectionUpdate
    - AutoCommitUpdate
    - CdnCacheUpdate
    - DataUpdate
    - DeferrableCallback
    - DeferrableUpdate
    - DeferredUpdates
    - DeferredUpdatesScope
    - DeferredUpdatesScopeMediaWikiStack
    - DeferredUpdatesScopeStack
    - EnqueueableDataUpdate
    - HtmlFileCacheUpdate
    - JobQueueEnqueueUpdate
    - MWCallableUpdate
    - MergeableUpdate
    - MessageCacheUpdate
    - SearchUpdate
    - SendPasswordResetEmailUpdate
    - SiteStatsUpdate
    - TransactionRoundAwareUpdate
    - TransactionRoundDefiningUpdate
    - UserEditCountInfo
    - UserEditCountUpdate
* API modules using ApiBase::requirePostedParameters() must also override
  mustBePosted() to return true.
* BlockManager::getUserBlock() was deprecated. Instead use
  BlockManager::getBlock(), which expects the caller to do ipblock-exempt
  checking.
* User::isBlocked(), ::isBlockedFromCreateAccount() and ::isBlockedFrom() now
  emit deprecation warnings. They were deprecated since 1.34, 1.37 and 1.33
  respectively.
* DatabaseBlock::newFromID() was deprecated and will emit deprecation warnings.
  Instead use DatabaseBlockStore::newFromID().
* DatabaseBlock::getAutoblockExpiry() was deprecated without replacement.
* MagicWord::getId() has been deprecated.
* MagicWordFactory::getSubstIDs() has been deprecated.
* Status::setMessageLocalizer is deprecated. Callers that want to control the
  localization of the Status object should obtain a StatusFormatter from
  the StatusFormatterFactory.
* Vuex has been deprecated in favor of its successor, Pinia. Though deprecated,
  Vuex 4 will remain accessible for the foreseeable future. Pinia should be used
  for new projects.
* Title::getBrokenLinksFrom() has been deprecated.
* ParserOutput::setLanguageLinks() has been deprecated.
* The module `mediawiki.icon` has been deprecated. Use the Codex mixin instead
 (T351681).

  Use PageUpdater instance.
