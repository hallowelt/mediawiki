See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.42 upgrades are below:

For notes on 1.41.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.42 ===

  will load on all platforms even if they are marked as desktop- or mobile-only
  in the 'targets' field, which is no longer read. As part of this, the internal
  methods RL\Module::setTarget() & ::getTargets(), and OutputPage::setTarget(),
  have been removed.

  the object.

  $settings parameter and pass it on when calling the parent implementation.
  MaintenanceRunner will always provide this parameter when calling
  finalSetup().
* MediaWiki's virtualrest internal library has been removed in favor of the
  HTTP library like: Guzzle, MultiHttpClient or MwHttpRequest.
* Several deprecated methods have been removed from the Content interface,
  in favor of the respective methods in ContentHandlers. Callers should

  when possible. The following methods have been removed from Content:

  - preloadTransform()
  - prepareSave()
* User::blockedFor() and AbstractBlock::getReason(), deprecated in 1.35, have

  - ::getReadConnectionRef(), deprecated in 1.38; use getReadConnection()

  has been removed. Use ::isLinkConversionDisabled() instead.

  now detects these automatically.
* Passing an actor id to the constructor of UserIdentityValue, deprecated
  since 1.36, is no longer being supported.
* Support for setting dynamic property on StatusValue object has been removed.
  To pass your arbitrary data along the object, use StatusValue::statusData
  property (which is always declared).

  removed.

  have been removed.
* UserOptionsLookup::getDefaultOptions() and
  UserOptionsLookup::getDefaultOption() now accept an UserIdentity, to
  take conditional defaults for user properties into account. When conditional
  defaults are used, calling those methods without the UserIdentity might

=== Deprecations in 1.42 ===
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.

  In this release of MediaWiki, XYZ classes now have a namespace and XYZ do
  not yet (XYZ% done, up from 63% in MediaWiki 1.41.0). The following have newly
  been moved:
  - MediaWiki\Deferred:
    - AtomicSectionUpdate
    - AutoCommitUpdate
    - CdnCacheUpdate
    - DataUpdate
    - DeferrableCallback
    - DeferrableUpdate
    - DeferredUpdates
    - DeferredUpdatesScope
    - DeferredUpdatesScopeMediaWikiStack
    - DeferredUpdatesScopeStack
    - EnqueueableDataUpdate
    - HtmlFileCacheUpdate
    - JobQueueEnqueueUpdate
    - MWCallableUpdate
    - MergeableUpdate
    - MessageCacheUpdate
    - SearchUpdate
    - SendPasswordResetEmailUpdate
    - SiteStatsUpdate
    - TransactionRoundAwareUpdate
    - TransactionRoundDefiningUpdate
    - UserEditCountInfo
    - UserEditCountUpdate
  - MediaWiki\Installer:

    - ParserOutput
  - MediaWiki\PoolCounter:
    - PoolCounter
    - PoolCounterNull
    - PoolCounterRedis
    - PoolCounterWork
    - PoolCounterWorkViaCallback
    - PoolWorkArticleView
    - PoolWorkArticleViewCurrent
    - PoolWorkArticleViewOld
  - MediaWiki\Site:
    - CachingSiteStore
    - DBSiteStore
    - HashSiteStore
    - MediaWikiSite
    - Site
    - SiteExporter
    - SiteImporter
    - SiteList
    - SiteLookup
    - SiteStore
* (T352284) Some user options-related classes were moved over to the existing
  MediaWiki\User\Options namespace. Old names are deprecated and kept as
  aliases for backwards-compatibility:
   - DefaultOptionsLookup
   - UserOptionsLookup
   - UserOptionsManager
   - StaticUserOptionsLookup
* API modules using ApiBase::requirePostedParameters() must also override
  mustBePosted() to return true.
* Overriding MWException::getHTML(), ::getText(), ::getPageTitle(), and
  ::reportHTML() in order to display custom exception messages is now
  deprecated. Provide the error message when constructing the Exception,
  or if you need a whole custom error page, use ErrorPageError instead.
* Using `new ImportReporter( … )` or `new ApiImportReporter( … )` without
  the $context parameter is now deprecated.
* Using `WikiImporterFactory::getWikiImporter()` without the $performer
  parameter is now deprecated.
* BlockManager::getUserBlock() was deprecated. Instead use
  BlockManager::getBlock(), which expects the caller to do ipblock-exempt
  checking.
* The `composer phpunit:entrypoint` entrypoint has been deprecated, along with
  bootstrap.integration.php and suite.xml. Run tests with `composer phpunit`
  instead, or simply `vendor/bin/phpunit`, which use bootstrap.php and
  phpunit.xml.dist.
* The global variable $wgCommandLineMode is deprecated. In most cases checks
  for `$wgCommandLineMode` can be replaced with `MW_ENTRY_POINT === 'cli'`.
* The global function wfUnpack is deprecated and emits deprecation
  warnings. Use StringUtils::unpack instead.
* User::isBlocked(), ::isBlockedFromCreateAccount() and ::isBlockedFrom() now
  emit deprecation warnings. They were deprecated since 1.34, 1.37 and 1.33
  respectively.
* DatabaseBlock::newFromID() was deprecated and will emit deprecation warnings.
  Instead use DatabaseBlockStore::newFromID().
* DatabaseBlock::getAutoblockExpiry() was deprecated without replacement.
* MagicWord::getId() has been deprecated.
* MagicWordFactory::getSubstIDs() has been deprecated.
* Status::setMessageLocalizer is deprecated. Callers that want to control the
  localization of the Status object should obtain a StatusFormatter from
  the StatusFormatterFactory.
* The MediaWiki class has been deprecated. Type hints in hooks should be
  changed to refer to MediaWikiEntryPoint instead. Note that extensions should
  not define their own entry points and should not interfere with the state of
  MediaWikiEntryPoint instances.
* Vuex has been deprecated in favor of its successor, Pinia. Though deprecated,
  Vuex 4 will remain accessible for the foreseeable future. Pinia should be used
  for new projects.
* Title::getBrokenLinksFrom() has been deprecated.
* ReplicatedBagOStuff has been deprecated since 1.42.
* ParserOutput::setLanguageLinks() has been deprecated.
* ApiQueryBlockInfoTrait::addBlockInfoToQuery() will emit deprecation warnings
  and will soon stop working due to schema changes. Instead use
  addDeletedUserFilter() or getBlockDetailsForRows().
* UploadBase::getImageInfo was deprecated, subclasses of ApiUpload can use
  ApiUpload::getUploadImageInfo() instead.
* DatabaseBlockStore::updateTimestamp() is now internal and should not be
  called.
* The LocalisationCache helper classes GlobalDependency and MainConfigDependency
  are deprecated, use ConfigDependency instead.
* The module `mediawiki.icon` has been deprecated. Use the Codex mixin instead
  (T351681).
* Passing a WikiPage to PageEditStash::parseAndCache() has been deprecated.
  Use PageUpdater instance.
* SpecialBlock::getSuggestedDurations() has been deprecated, use
  Language::getBlockDurations() instead.
* Database::listViews() has been deprecated. This was previously used to filter
  views out of the return value of Database::listTables(). Now listTables()
  will not include views. MediaWiki does not use views.
* (T207621) UserMailer::rfc822Phrase() has been hard deprecated.
* TempUserConfig::getMatchPattern has been deprecated, use
  TempUserConfig::getMatchPatterns instead.
* …

=== Other changes in 1.42 ===
* Gallery: Image captions are no longer wrapped in <p> tags. Skins that
  customize rendering for galleries may need to tweak their CSS.
* Scripts under maintenance/dev/, for quickly setup a local MediaWiki for
  development purposes, have been removed, see DEVELOPERS.md for alternatives.
* …

== Mailing list ==
A mailing list is available for MediaWiki user support and discussion:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-l

A low-traffic announcements-only list is also available:

       https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/mediawiki-announce

It's highly recommended that you sign up for one of these lists if you're
going to run a public MediaWiki, so you can be notified of security fixes.
