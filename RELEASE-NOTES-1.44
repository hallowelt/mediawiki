== MediaWiki 1.44.0-PRERELEASE ==

THIS IS NOT A RELEASE YET

MediaWiki 1.44 is an alpha-quality development branch, and is not recommended
for use in production.

== Upgrading notes for 1.44 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.44 upgrades are below:

* …

For notes on 1.43.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.44 ===

* (T382987) The default value of 'http.dnsbl.sorbs.net.' in $wgDnsBlacklistUrls
  has been removed. This is because sorbs.net have stopped providing their
  services. This means that if you have $wgEnableDnsBlacklist set to true, it
  will no longer provide any value unless you add other servers to
  $wgDnsBlacklistUrls.
* …

==== New configuration ====

* (T377829) $wgAutopromoteOnceRCExcludedGroups - Defaults to an empty list, can
  be used to define a denylist of user group names. One-shot autopromotions
  into these groups will never result in an RC entry, even if
  $wgAutopromoteOnceLogInRC is true, as long as they were the only new groups
  the user was autopromoted into.
* …

==== Changed configuration ====

* (T13555) $wgParserEnableLegacyHeadingDOM now defaults to `false`.
  You can set it to `true` to temporarily restore the legacy HTML markup
  for wikitext headings in the output from the Parser, in case you find
  that your wiki's content or an extension is incompatible with the new markup.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
  This option will be removed in a future release.
* (T382987) $wgDnsBlacklistUrls now defaults to an empty array. See the comment
  in the "Configuration changes for system administrators" section above.

==== Removed configuration ====

* wgResourceLoaderUseObjectCacheForDeps, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
  It is now always enabled (T343492).
* wgBaseDirectory, unused, has been removed in favour of MW_INSTALL_PATH.
  If a variable value is needed, inject an optional parameter instead.
* …

=== New user-facing features in 1.44 ===

* (T363538, T204792) New parser functions {{#interlanguagelink:prefix|title}}
  and {{#interwikilink:prefix|title|caption}} to unambiguously create
  interlanguage and interwiki links, respectively, even when the "prefix"
  might conflict with a namespace on the local wiki.
* (T326057) Attempting to create a redirect to a nonexistent page will now
  result in a warning.
* (T33951) The Interwiki extension has been moved to MediaWiki core. It is now
  possible to view and edit the interwiki table without installing an extension.
  $wgInterwikiCentralDB and $wgInterwikiCentralInterlanguageDB have been
  removed, use $wgVirtualDomainsMapping['virtual-interwiki'] and
  $wgVirtualDomainsMapping['virtual-interwiki-interlanguage'] instead.
  $wgInterwikiViewOnly has been removed, (un)assign "interwiki" right instead.
* (T302140) Rollbacked edits are marked as manually patrolled instead of
  auto-patrolled since the rollback action was a manual patrol of the edit.
* (T56145) Introduces a new tag 'mw-recreated' to note edits which create pages
 that have been previously deleted by having an associated deletion log entry.
 This does not consider deletion log entries that were suppressed.
* …

=== Breaking changes in 1.44 ===

* In StatusValue::replaceMessage(), ::hasMessage() and ::hasMessagesExcept()
  passing MessageSpecifier or MessageValue as $source, deprecated in 1.43,
  is no longer allowed.
* StatusValue will no longer accept errors given as a MessageSpecifier
  combined with a parameters array. This was deprecated in 1.43.
* The methods MessageValue::objectParams(), Message::objectParams()
  and Message::objectParam(), deprecated in 1.43, have been removed.
* The UserGroupMembershipParam class, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The ParamType::OBJECT constant, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The MediaWiki\Message\Converter class, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
  Use MessageValue::newFromSpecifier or Message::newFromSpecifier
  instead (T358779).
* Return type declarations were added to methods in `includes/libs/Message`,
  specifically in the `MessageSpecifier`, `ITextFormatter`, and
  `IMessageFormatterFactory` interfaces. This update enhances type safety but
  may require updates in any classes implementing these interfaces, including
  external extensions. Extensions such as Translate, Flow, and ReadingLists
  require compatibility patches to support these changes.
* IDatabase::LB_TRX_ROUND_ID was removed and IDatabase::LB_READ_ONLY_REASON
  was marked as an internal constant.
* The ParsoidOutputAccess class marked @unstable from creation and
  deprecated with all of its methods in 1.43, has been removed.
* (T382030) MediaWiki core database schema and schema changes have been moved
  to a new top-level sql/ directory. This should only affect code directly
  referencing the old paths.
* The HtmlToContentTransform::setMetrics() and
  HtmlInputTransformHelper::setMetrics() methods now require a StatsFactory
  argument.  Passing a StatsdDataFactoryInterface was deprecated in 1.43.
* IDatabase::onAtomicSectionCancel() has been removed without deprecation
  as it's completely unused.
* The method ParserOptions::setupFakeRevision has been marked internal. It
  will remain backwards compatible in 1.44 but may change without notice in
  1.45 or later.
* ISQLPlatform::tableNames(), deprecated since 1.39, has been removed.
* The Less mixin .column-break-after-avoid(), deprecated in 1.43, has been
  removed. Use just the CSS rule `break-after: avoid-column;` instead now.
* ApiBase::errorArrayToStatus(), deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* ZipDirectoryReader has been moved to the Wikimedia\Mime library.
  No callers outside that library are known.
* The MediaWiki\Config\MutableConfig interface now extends
  MediaWiki\Config\Config. Implementing MutableConfig without implementing
  Config is no longer possible.
* The hook OutputPageMakeCategoryLinks, deprecated in 1.43, has been removed.
* The methods Skin::getFooterIcons and ::makeFooterIcon are final and
  overriding is no longer supported.
* …

=== Deprecations in 1.44 ===

* Various static methods on ChangeTags, deprecated since 1.41, each now emit
  deprecation warnings. Use service access to the ChangeTagsStore instead:
  addTags(), defineTag(), deleteTagEverywhere(), getDisplayTableName(),
  getSoftwareTags(), getTags(), getTagsWithData(), listDefinedTags(),
  listExplicitlyDefinedTags(), listSoftwareActivatedTags(),
  listSoftwareDefinedTags(), makeTagSummarySubquery(), modifyDisplayQuery(),
  purgeTagCacheAll(), tagUsageStatistics(), and updateTags().
* WikiPage::doEditUpdates(), deprecated since 1.32, is now emitting warnings.
  Use DerivedPageDataUpdater::doUpdates() instead.
* IDatabase::setTransactionListener() is now deprecated without replacement.
* ILBFactory::setWaitForReplicationListener() is now deprecated without
  replacement.
* Maintenance::beginTransaction(), Maintenance::commitTransaction(),
  Maintenance::rollbackTransaction(), and Maintenance::waitForReplication()
  are now deprecated. Use Maintenance::*TransactionRound() instead.
* The ReverseArrayIterator class, unused since 1.32, has been deprecated.
* LinksUpdate::getImages() has been deprecated, like ParserOutput::getImages().
  Instead, use ParserOutput::getLinkList( ParserOutputLinkTypes::MEDIA ).
* ResourceLoader::makeConfigSetScript() is now deprecated. Consider using
  package files instead. Or, you can return "mw.config.set()" combined with
  RL\Context::encodeJson, if available. If not, use FormatJson::encode.
* The parameter $default in WebRequest::getRawVal(), deprecated since 1.43,
  is now emitting warnings.
* …

=== Other changes in 1.44 ===
* The ArticleProtect and ArticleProtectComplete hooks are now called when
  WikiPage::doUpdateRestrictions is called to protect a non-existing
  title.
* Introduce ISearchResultSet::isApproximateTotalHits() (defaults to false
  in BaseSearchResultSet) to let SearchEngine implementations run optimizations
  that might lead to innacurate computation of the exact number of pages
  matching the search query.
* …
